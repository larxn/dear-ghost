## Intro

Last year changed the way I write short-stories. Large language models opened new ways to do it. So I started building this text-editor to explore those new ways.

The thing is: as I built it, I realized I didn’t want to have a commercial relationship with this project. That’s why I’m open sourcing it.

## Setup

Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:luveqz/dear-ghost.git
cd dear-ghost
```

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Dev Server

Start the development server on [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000):

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Build

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Contributing

I would love to hear about other ways to build a fiction/memoir writing tool, but also want to be clear about this being a very personal, opinionated one. Please have this in mind before working on a PR.

Maybe the best starting point for a contribution could be a more casual chat. Feel free to reach out.
